chapter 7
if there is hope, wrote winston, it lies in the proles. if there was hope,
it must lie in the proles, because only there in those swarming disregarded masses,
85 per cent of the population of oceania, could the force to destroy
the party ever be generated. the party could not be overthrown from within.
its enemies, if it had any enemies, had no way of coming together or even
of identifying one another. even if the legendary brotherhood existed, as just
possibly it might, it was inconceivable that its members could ever assemble
in larger numbers than twos and threes. rebellion meant a look in the eyes,
an inflexion of the voice, at the most, an occasional whispered word.
but the proles, if only they could somehow become conscious of their own
strength. would have no need to conspire. they needed only to rise up and shake
themselves like a horse shaking off flies. if they chose they could blow
the party to pieces tomorrow morning. surely sooner or later it must
occur to them to do it? and yet!
